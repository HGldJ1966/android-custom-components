Custom Components for Android
===========

This application demos some custom components for Android.

It's best understood in conjuction with Paul Lammertsma's talk, *Custom Components*.

> Android offers a powerful model for building user interfaces, based on fundamental layout components View and ViewGroup. The platform includes a prebuilt set that you can use to construct your UI, but making your own may be easier than you think and it will make your code around complex UIs cleaner and much easier to understand.
>
> In this talk I'll explain how some of Android's widgets and layouts are put together and how you can expand on them. I'll demonstrate creating a custom font widget, an animated view, and how everything neatly fits together in layouts, themes, and yes, even inside Eclipse's graphical layout.
