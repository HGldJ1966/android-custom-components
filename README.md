mdevcon 2013: *Custom Components, Easier than you think!*
===========

The associated code from Paul Lammertsma's talk.

> Android offers a powerful model for building user interfaces, based on fundamental layout components View and ViewGroup. The platform includes a prebuilt set that you can use to construct your UI, but making your own may be easier than you thinkâ€”and it will make your code around complex UIs cleaner and much easier to understand.
>
> In this talk I'll explain how some of Android's widgets and layouts are put together and how you can expand on them. I'll demonstrate creating a custom font widget, an animated view, and how everything neatly fits together in layouts, themes, and yes, even inside Eclipse's graphical layout.
